I am a Research Assistant within the Arthritis UK Pain Centre working within the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre at the University of Nottingham. Prior to attaining my MSc and PhD at the University of Nottingham I studied BSc Medical Sciences at the University of Leeds.

My research interests are in using neuroimaging to better understand the central (brain-based) components underlying chronic pain. Specifically, I am interested in the measure of brain connectivity and metabolism and how that relates to chronic pain states.

My current work within the Arthritis Research UK Pain Centre is looking at phenotyping and longitudinal assessments of people with chronic knee osteoarthritis pain.
