Research interests: Brain, Chronic pain, Connectivity, Phenotypes, Coordinate-based meta analysis
======

My research interests are in using neuroimaging to better understand the central (brain-based) components underlying chronic pain. Specifically, I am interested in measures of brain connectivity (static, dynamic and/or effective) and metabolism and how that relates to chronic pain states. At the moment I do this using BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) and ASL (Arterial Spin Labelling) functional MRI. 

My current work within the Arthritis Research UK Pain Centre is looking at phenotyping and longitudinal assessments of people with chronic knee osteoarthritis pain.
